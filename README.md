# 16-bit index expansion for Crystal

This repository contains a modified Pokémon Crystal game, updated to handle 16-bit indexes. Based on https://github.com/aaaaaa123456789/pokecrystal16. See https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal for more info on the pokecrystal disassembly.

Features in this version include:
- Many Pokémon from later generations, including regional forms
- Several Pokémon from the Gold and Silver beta
- Altered trainer parties and wild encounters to include newly added Pokémon and provide a smoother and slightly more challenging level curve
- Over 600 moves, including moves from later generations and a handful of original moves
- Physical/special split
- Fairy type
- A move reminder in Blackthorn City (the move deleter has been moved to Cherrygrove instead)
- Viridian Forest and Seafoam Islands, restored to their full sizes
- A list of 99 infinitely reusable TMs (that use a separate index system from items)
- A Gen 6+ style experience system, with full experience for each battler, experience from catching, and an Exp. All that is toggleable from the options menu
- Starters randomly selected from across the generations
- Rematches against gym leaders and the Kimono Girls
- Gender differences for several Pokémon and random colors for the Flabebe line and Minior's Core form
- Newer Poké Ball types
- More bag pockets
- Marts that share a common inventory between cities and gain more items as you progress
- A display on the Buy menu for marts that shows you how many of each item are already in your bag
- Pokédex opening after evolutions and hatching

and a ton of other upgrades, fixes, and tweaks. See the [wiki](https://github.com/DanielOlivaw/pokecrystal16/wiki) for artist credits and some useful hints and tips.

Feel free to try this out for yourself. If you have any problems or have questions about how I did something, open an issue and I'll try to respond when I can.
