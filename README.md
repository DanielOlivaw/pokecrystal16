# 16-bit index expansion for Crystal

This repository contains a modified Pokémon Crystal game, updated to handle 16-bit indexes. Based on https://github.com/aaaaaa123456789/pokecrystal16. See https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal for more info on the pokecrystal disassembly.

Features in this version include:
- Many Pokémon from later generations, including regional forms
- Several Pokémon from the Gold and Silver beta
- Altered trainer parties and wild encounters
- Over 600 moves, including moves from later generations and a handful of original moves
- Physical/special split
- Fairy type
- A move reminder
- Full maps for Viridian Forest and Seafoam Islands
- A list of 99 infinitely reusable TMs (that don't use item slots)
- Gen 6+ style Exp. All, toggleable from the options menu
- Starters randomly selected from across the generations
- Newer Poké Ball types
- More bag pockets
- Standardized marts that gain more items as you progress
- Pokédex opening after evolutions and hatching

and a ton of other upgrades, fixes, and tweaks.

Feel free to try this out for yourself. If you have any problems or have questions about how I did something, open an issue and I'll try to respond when I can.
